## 📅 Challenge Timeline
- **Day 7** → Built a complete **E-Commerce Website** from scratch.

## 📌 Overview
The **Leka E-Commerce Website** is a fully responsive, modern website that I designed and developed using **HTML5 and CSS3**.  
This project was a huge step forward — instead of just a page, I built a **complete website layout**, practicing **every CSS property** I had revised so far.  

The site is designed to be **responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop**, ensuring a seamless shopping experience across all devices.
