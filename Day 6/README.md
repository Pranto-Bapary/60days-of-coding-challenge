# 🚀 Day 6 - Mini Landing Page

## 📅 Challenge Timeline
- **Day 6** → Built a **fully responsive landing page** using everything I’ve recapped so far.

---

## 📌 Overview
On Day 6 of my **60 Days of Code Challenge**, I created a **mini landing page** from scratch.  
This project combined **HTML5 semantics, CSS fundamentals, Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design** into one cohesive page.  

The landing page includes **five structured sections**:
1. **Navigation Bar** (sticky at top)  
2. **Header** → Showcasing my introduction/info  
3. **Future Goals Section**  
4. **Experience Section**  
5. **Footer**

- **Positioning** → `relative`, `absolute`, `sticky` for precise control  
- **Responsive Design** → Used `em`, `rem`, `%`, `fr`, `px` with **media queries** for mobile, tablet, and desktop
