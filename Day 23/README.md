Welcome to <b>Day 23</b> of my <b>60 Days of Coding Challenge</b> 🚀  
Today, I practiced and learned the <b>React Context API</b> by building a small <b>Login & Profile</b> flow to understand how global state works across components without prop drilling.
</p>

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Why **Context API** is needed in React
- Creating context using `createContext()`
- Sharing global state with a **Context Provider**
- Consuming context using the `useContext()` hook
- Updating shared state from nested components
- Eliminating **prop drilling** in real scenarios

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered

- ✅ Global state management (basic)
- ✅ `createContext()`
- ✅ Context Provider pattern
- ✅ `useContext()` hook
- ✅ Conditional rendering based on login state
- ✅ Clean and maintainable component logic

---

## 🧪 Practice Implementation

- Built a simple **Login page** to update global user/auth state
- Built a **Profile page** that consumes user data from Context
- Used Context API to manage authentication state globally
- Controlled UI rendering based on login / logout
- Focused on understanding data flow instead of complex UI

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Context API is ideal for **authentication state**, themes, and shared UI data
- Makes component structure cleaner and easier to scale
- Reduces unnecessary prop passing
- Should be used carefully for frequently updating state

---

## 🔜 What’s Next

- Context API with `useReducer`
- Better global state patterns
- Moving towards Redux Toolkit / Zustand
