# 📘 Day 09 - Arrays & Objects Practice

Welcome to **Day 9** of my **60 Days of Coding Challenge**!  
Today, I worked on **JavaScript Arrays and Objects** — learning how to create, modify, and manipulate them with built-in methods.

---

## 📚 Topics Revised
- 🔹 **Array Basics**: push, pop, shift, unshift, reverse
- 🔹 **Array Iteration**: `forEach`, `for...of`
- 🔹 **Objects**: creation, property access (`dot` & `bracket` notation)
- 🔹 **Iterating Objects**: `for...in` loop
- 🔹 **Array Methods**:
  - `map()` → transform elements
  - `filter()` → filter elements by condition
  - `reduce()` → accumulate values
- 🔹 Combining **map + filter + reduce**
- 🔹 Objects inside arrays & nested structures

## 🛠️ Practice Work
- Modified arrays using `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, and `reverse`.  
- Iterated arrays with **forEach** and **for...of**.  
- Created and accessed objects with `.` and `[]`.  
- Used **map, filter, reduce** to:
  - Double, square, and filter numbers
  - Capitalize names
  - Sum and multiply numbers
  - Count fruit frequency in an array  
- Practiced object-based problems:
  - Users list → filter valid users, find oldest, total age  
  - Orders list → total price per order, filter by amount, grand total  
  - Library → filter by author, extract titles, count recent books

## 🚀 Output Highlights

- ✅ Practiced all major array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach)

- ✅ Understood how to combine methods to solve problems

- ✅ Learned object manipulation (add, delete, update properties)

- ✅ Solved exercises with arrays of objects (users, orders, library)
