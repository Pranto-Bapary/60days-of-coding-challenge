## 📌 Overview

As part of my **60 Days of Code Challenge**, today’s focus was on making layouts **responsive across different screen sizes**.  
I built two separate responsive layouts:

- One using **Flexbox**
- One using **CSS Grid**

## 🛠️ Features

- **Responsive Flexbox Layout:**

  - Used `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`
  - Adjusted column/row direction with media queries

- **Responsive Grid Layout:**

  - Applied `grid-template-columns` with `repeat()` and `auto-fit/auto-fill`
  - Created adaptive grids for mobile, tablet, and desktop

- **Media Queries:**
  - Implemented breakpoints for **small (≤600px)**, **medium (≤900px)**, and **large (desktop)** screens

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Applying **media queries** for multiple breakpoints
- Designing with a **mobile-first approach**
- Differences between **Flexbox** vs **Grid responsiveness**
- Using **relative units** (`em`, `rem`, `%`, `fr`) for flexible layouts

## ✅ Reflection

Responsive design is the **heart of modern frontend development** 🌍.  
By practicing both **Flexbox and Grid responsiveness**, I now feel more confident in creating layouts that adapt to all devices — from mobile to large desktop screens.  
This was a **big step toward real-world, production-ready development** 🔥
