Welcome to <b>Day 18</b> of my <b>60 Days of Coding Challenge</b>!  
Today, I deepened my understanding of <b>React Hooks</b>, especially <b>useState</b>, by building a fun and interactive <b>Background Color Changer App</b>.  
I also practiced more with <b>Tailwind CSS</b> to style and make the app fully responsive.  
This project was created using <b>Vite</b> ⚡ and deployed on <b>Netlify</b> 🚀.
