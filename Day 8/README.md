# 📘 Day 08 - JavaScript Basics Revision

Welcome to **Day 8** of my **60 Days of Coding Challenge**!  
Today, I revised the **core JavaScript fundamentals** that are the building blocks for writing efficient code.

---

## 📚 Topics Revised
- 🔹 **Variables**: `let`, `var`, `const`
- 🔹 **Comments** (single-line & multi-line)
- 🔹 **Data Types** (primitive & reference types)
- 🔹 **Conditionals** (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- 🔹 **Switch Case** statements
- 🔹 **Break & Loop Control**
- 🔹 **Loops** (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
- 🔹 **Functions** (declaration & expression)
- 🔹 **Template Strings** (string interpolation with backticks)
- 🔹 **Arrow Functions** (modern concise syntax)

---

## 🛠️ Practice Work
- Wrote small snippets using `let`, `const`, and `var` to see scoping differences.  
- Practiced conditionals with **if-else** and **switch-case**.  
- Explored different **looping techniques** to iterate over numbers.  
- Created functions for tasks like showing name, id and condition checks.  
- Converted traditional functions into **arrow functions**.  
- Used **template strings** to insert variables directly into strings.
