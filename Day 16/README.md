Welcome to <b>Day 16</b> of my <b>60 Days of Coding Challenge</b>!  
Today, I learned about <b>React Hooks</b>, especially <b>useState</b>, and explored how to apply <b>CSS styling</b> inside React projects.  
As a hands-on project, I built a modern and elegant <b>Counter App</b> with increment, decrement, and reset features.  
This project was created using <b>Vite</b> ⚡ and deployed on <b>Netlify</b> 🚀.
