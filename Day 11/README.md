Welcome to **Day 11** of my **60 Days of Coding Challenge**!  
Today, I built a **Task Management App** — a feature-rich upgrade from a simple to-do app.  
It comes with **add, update, delete tasks**, persistent storage using **LocalStorage**, and smooth **animations** for a better user experience. 🎉
