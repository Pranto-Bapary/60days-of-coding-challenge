Welcome to **Day 14** of my **60 Days of Coding Challenge**!  
Today, I built a fully functional **Weather App** 🌤️ that fetches live weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
It comes with **LocalStorage support** to save and display recently searched cities/locations, so you can revisit your weather history anytime! ⚡
